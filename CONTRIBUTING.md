## FXML files

For editing fxml files, use the "JavaFX Scene Builder" in version 8.5.0.  
Layouting is generally done with fxml files.

For fontawesome support add Libraries
`de.jensd:fontawsomefx-commons:8.15`
`de.jensd:fontawsomefx-fontawsome:4.7.0-5`
to the "JavaFX Scene Builder"

Scene Builder may sometimes delete unicode Charakters when fxml file is changed.
reset Glyph Name to reset uniocode Charakter.
